# Welcome to out YouTube App in Advanced Programming Project !
The course took place in our 2nd year of computer science in Bar-Ilan university, we did this project throughout the second semester.

Our project was to build a YouTube app, both for web and android. In the web part we used react, node.js, css, HTML, CPP. And in the android we used android studio.
In this project we also implemented a server side that was working with a local MongoDB for updating and getting data base for our users and posts of the application.

In the project we had 4 phases :
1) Building the app of YouTube in React website and android studio.
2) Building a Node.js server and implementing MVC structure for web and adding functions to the configuration of the web application in Node.js server.
3) Building and implementing MVVM for android and connection to all the functions of the Node.js server.
4) Building a TCP server and communicates with the Node.js server through a client-server architecture, the Node.js server sends a request to the TCP server to fetch video recommendations based on the user's watch history.

This wiki folder will contain 4 parts. <br>
First one, as you can see is the introduction. The second, will be about how to run the TCP server. The third, will be about how to run the Node.js server. the fourth, will be about the web YouTube app. and in the fifth part, will be about the android YouTube app. <br>

We will explain everything in here, including photos and videos and yet we still reccommend you to go and read the README for each part, so you'll also be able to see our work in progress. <br>
